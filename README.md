# Tax-Filing-Pattern-Classification
Tax Filing Patterns via Classification &amp; Clustering

# Goal  
Use machine learning to analyze and predict taxpayer 
behavior from real-world data (provided by Nesban Solutions).
Objectives:
Clustering: Segment taxpayers and uncover behavioral profiles 
(e.g., early filers, refund-seekers).
Classification: Predict whether a taxpayer will receive a refund or owe taxes.
Key Features Analyzed:
Filing date, income, tax withheld, dependents, employment type, filing status.
Impact:
Supports fraud detection, audit prioritization, and targeted ads.
Valuable for both clients and tax professionals.
